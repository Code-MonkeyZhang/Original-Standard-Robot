  *             gyro mode: use euler angle to control, encond mode: use enconde

    add a gimbal behaviour mode
    1. in gimbal_behaviour.h , add a new behaviour name in gimbal_behaviour_e
    erum
    {
        ...
        ...
        GIMBAL_XXX_XXX, // new add
    }gimbal_behaviour_e,
    2. implement new function. gimbal_xxx_xxx_control(fp32 *yaw, fp32 *pitch, gimbal_control_t *gimbal_control_set);
        "yaw, pitch" param is gimbal movement contorl input.
        first param: 'yaw' usually means  yaw axis move,usaully means increment angle.
            positive value means counterclockwise move, negative value means clockwise move.
        second param: 'pitch' usually means pitch axis move,usaully means increment angle.
            positive value means counterclockwise move, negative value means clockwise move.

        in this new function, you can assign set-point to "yaw" and "pitch",as your wish
    3.  in "gimbal_behavour_set" function, add new logical judgement to assign GIMBAL_XXX_XXX to  "gimbal_behaviour" variable,
        and in the last of the "gimbal_behaviour_mode_set" function, add "else if(gimbal_behaviour == GIMBAL_XXX_XXX)"
        choose a gimbal control mode.
        four mode:
        GIMBAL_MOTOR_RAW : will use 'yaw' and 'pitch' as motor current set,  derectly sent to can bus.
        GIMBAL_MOTOR_ENCONDE : 'yaw' and 'pitch' are angle increment,  control enconde relative angle.
        GIMBAL_MOTOR_GYRO : 'yaw' and 'pitch' are angle increment,  control gyro absolute angle.
    4. in the last of "gimbal_behaviour_control_set" function, add
        else if(gimbal_behaviour == GIMBAL_XXX_XXX)
        {
            gimbal_xxx_xxx_control(&rc_add_yaw, &rc_add_pit, gimbal_control_set);
